A simple blog application created with Ruby on Rails, based off of a tutorial found on Youtube.
This has not been updated in a long time and as such Github has found some vulnerabilities in some of the gems used. 
I will address this shortly. If you're interested in building a similar blog, I reccommend watching the tutorial video on youtube. I'll add the link in soon.
